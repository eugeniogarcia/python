    "# Keras custom callbacks\n",
    "A custom callback is a powerful tool to customize the behavior of a Keras model during training, evaluation, or inference, including reading/changing the Keras model. Examples include `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` where the training progress and results can be exported and visualized with TensorBoard, or `tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` where the model is automatically saved during training, and more. In this guide, you will learn what Keras callback is, when it will be called, what it can do, and how you can build your own. Towards the end of this guide, there will be demos of creating a couple of simple callback applications to get you started on your custom callback."

    "## Introduction to Keras callbacks\n",
    "In Keras, `Callback` is a python class meant to be subclassed to provide specific functionality, with a set of methods called at various stages of training (including batch/epoch start and ends), testing, and predicting. Callbacks are useful to get a view on internal states and statistics of the model during training. You can pass a list of callbacks (as the keyword argument `callbacks`) to any of `tf.keras.Model.fit()`, `tf.keras.Model.evaluate()`, and `tf.keras.Model.predict()` methods. The methods of the callbacks will then be called at different stages of training/evaluating/inference.\n",
